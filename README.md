Love all things Javascript, from vanilla to React and Next. Styling of choice has to be SASS, but styled comps and Tailwind are cool too.

## My goals

- Level up skills by building real world applications for users and clients.
- Learn Typescript and deep dive into Javascript in all its glorious complexity.
