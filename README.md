Junior web developer who enjoys building front end and full stack web apps. 

## What I love to do 

Love all things Javascript, from vanilla to NextJS. Styling of choice has to be SASS, but styled comps and Tailwind are cool too.

## My goals

- Grow as a developer by joining a team. 
- Level up skills by building real world applications for users and clients.
- Learn Typescript and deep dive into Javascript in all its glorious complexity.
