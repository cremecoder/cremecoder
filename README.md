Web developer who enjoys building frontend and full stack websites and apps. 

## What I love to do 

Love all things Javascript, from vanilla to React and Node. Styling of choice has to be SASS, but styled comps and Tailwind are cool too.

## My goals

- Grow as a full stack developer and join a team. 
- Level up skills by building full stack applications for users and clients.
- Learn Typescript and deep dive into Javascript in all its glorious complexity.
